            Hi! My name is Holly Wang, and I’m a sophomore at Canyon Crest Academy.
            I was born in China and moved to the U.S. in eighth grade. This
            experience taught me how to adjust to new environments. It helped me
            become more confident, independent, and open-minded. I enjoy
            learning about both technology and psychology because they help me
            understand how people think and how the world works. Outside of
            school, I love spending time with my Border Collie, Coconut, and
            relaxing with music or watching anime.

            One of my biggest interests is
            <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/sports/badminton/" target="_blank"
              >badminton</a
            >. I’m a member of
            <a
              href="https://www.instagram.com/ccabadminton/?hl=en"
              target="_blank"
              >my school’s badminton team</a
            >, where I enjoy improving my skills and competing with my teammates.
            The sport helps me stay active and focused while also teaching me
            teamwork and patience. Besides sports, I like designing digital
            projects and exploring new AI tools. In my free time, I often read
            manga or listen to K-pop to unwind.

          <h3>Future Goals</h3>

            In the future, I hope to study something related to Cognitive
            Science, Artificial Intelligence, or business connected to
            technology. I find it fascinating how AI can learn from human
            behavior and emotions to create smarter systems. I’m also curious
            about how psychology in AI could influence business and decision
            making in the future. During the summer, I joined the
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >Wharton Global Youth AI Leadership Program</a
            >
            to explore how technology and human thinking work together.
