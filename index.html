<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Holly Wang, and I’m a sophomore at Canyon Crest Academy. I was born in China and moved to the U.S. when I was in eighth grade, which was both exciting and challenging. Moving to a new country helped me become more independent and open minded. I enjoy learning about technology and psychology because they help me understand both the world and people better. Outside of school, I love spending time with my Border Collie, Coconut, and relaxing with music or anime.</p>

<h1>My Interests</h1>
<p>I’m really interested in Artificial Intelligence and how it connects with human psychology. I find it fascinating how AI can learn from human behavior and emotions to create smarter systems. I’m also curious about how psychology in AI could influence business and decision making in the future. During the summer, I joined the Wharton Global Youth AI Leadership Program to explore how technology and human thinking work together. In my free time, I love watching anime, listening to K-pop, and designing digital projects.</p>

<h1>My Future Goals</h1>
<p>In the future, I hope to study something related to Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence, or business connected to technology. I want to explore how AI and psychology can be used to solve real problems and inspire new ideas. I’m also interested in learning how technology influences people’s choices and the way companies grow. My goal is to keep learning and stay curious about the world. I want to find ways to connect people, ideas, and technology in meaningful ways.</p>
